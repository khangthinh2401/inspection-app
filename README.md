## What is Angular?

__Angular__ is a TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations.

__Angular__ is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS (an older version of Angular).

As a platform, Angular includes:

- A component-based framework for building scales web apps.
- A collection of well-integrated  libraries that cover a wide variety of features.
- A suit of developer tools to help us develop, build, test, and update our code.

## Components in Angular

Angular is a component-based web framework. So what really component is in Angular?

__Components__ are the building blocks that compose an application. A component includes a TypeScript class with a `@component()` decorator, an HTML template, and styles. The `@component()` decorator specifies the following Angular-specific information:

- A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template. HTML elements in your template that match this selector becomes instances of the the components.
- An HTML template that instructs Angular how to render the component.
- An optional set of CSS styles that define the appearance of the template's HTML elements.

## Templates in Angular

Every component has an HTML template that declares how that component renders. You can define this template either inline or by file path.
